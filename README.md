# NorthWind_CS

This project is a simple CRUD web application that uses Microsoft ASP.NET MVC, C#, Entity Framework, Twitter Bootstrap, and SQL Server with a copy of the Northwind database from Microsoft. It is very similar to the NorthWind_VB repo that I have also put here on Github. I used AI (Prome AI, Chat GPT) to help me make the logo and write the main page.

I still have a lot of work to do. I have included Angular and have been learning that and Typescript, so I plan to add some components using those technologies later.
